# Exercise W1-E1

__IMPORTANT__: Before you start, make sure you're working from inside the virtual machine (VM) that you setup for the course.

## Instructions

1. Open a new Terminal window.

2. Go to `/home/ubuntu/Dev/praticas-devsoft/infosimples-repo/week1/exercises/w1-e1`.

  NOTE: the next steps assume this is your working directory. If you change directory using `cd`, you might need to adapt those steps accordingly.

3. Create a new, empty file in this directory named `w1-e1-solution.sh`.
4. Write, in the file you just created, a _shell script_ (that is, a sequence of Unix commands) that creates the directories and files shown in the picture below.

5. Now, you will test your solution. To do that:
  1. Delete any temporary files and/or directories you created in step __4__.
  2. Run your script (hint: make sure the file is executable).
  3. Check if all files and/or directories were created as expected.

6. Run the following:
  ```
  $ rspec w1-e1-spec.rb
  ```

  The command above will run a script that performs automated tests on your solution.
  If your script does not perform as expected, errors will be reported and you should fix them before proceeding to the next step.

  The picture below shows what should happen if everything goes well:

7. Run the following command to submit your exercise:
  ```
  # IMPORTANT: replace "XXXXXX" with your N.USP.
  $ ./w1-e1-submit.sh XXXXXX
  ```

  Output example:

# Exercise W3-E3

## TL;DR

Create a ruby script (`w3-e3-solution.rb`) with a function **sort** that sorts
an array of integers.

Example: for the array `[3, 1, 7]` it is expected to return the array `[1, 3, 7]`.


## Step-by-step instructions

1. Open a new Terminal window.

2. Go to `/home/ubuntu/Dev/praticas-devsoft/infosimples-repo/week3/exercises/w3-e3`.

  NOTE: the next steps assume this is your working directory. If you change
  directory using `cd`, you might need to adapt those steps accordingly.

3. Create a new, empty file in this directory named `w3-e3-solution.rb`.

4. Write, in the file you just created, a function **sort** that sorts an array
of integers and return it sorted.

6. Run the automated tests on your solution:
  ```
  $ rspec w3-e3-spec.rb
  ```

  The command above will run a script that performs automated tests on your
  solution.
  If your script does not perform as expected, errors will be reported and you
  should fix them before proceeding to the next step.

7. Submit your exercise, by pushing your branch to GitHub. The push should
update the branch w3/YOUR_NUSP.

  ```
  git push origin w3/YOUR_NUSP
  ```

8. Check your submission by going to:

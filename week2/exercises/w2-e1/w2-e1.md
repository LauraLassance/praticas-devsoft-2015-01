# Exercise W2-E1

__IMPORTANT__: Before you start, make sure you have followed the <a href="https://github.com/infosimples/praticas-devsoft-2015-01/blob/master/week2/exercises/README.md" target="_blank">Week 2 Setup Instructions</a>.

1. Clone the Git repository from <a href="https://github.com/infosimples/praticas-devsoft-2015-01-w2" target="_blank">https://github.com/infosimples/praticas-devsoft-2015-01-w2</a> into the directory `~/Dev/praticas-devsoft/infosimples-repo-w2`.

  __NOTE__: Use the following URL to clone the repository: `git@github.com:infosimples/praticas-devsoft-2015-01-w2.git`.

2. `cd` to the repository you just cloned.

3. Setup the repository with your name and email, with the commands below. Replace "John Doe" and "john.doe@gmail.com" with your own name and email, respectively.

  ```
  git config user.name "John Doe"
  git config user.email "john.doe@gmail.com"
  ```

3. Make sure you are in the `master` branch.

  __Hint__: use the `git branch` command to do that.

4. Create a new branch, named `u_NUSP/b1`.

  __Hint__: use the `git branch` command to do that (yes, it's the same command from the previous step!).

5. Checkout to that branch.

  __Hint__: use the `git checkout` command to do that.

6. Make sure you are in the `u_NUSP/b1` branch.

  __Hint__: use the `git branch` command to do that.

7. Run the automated tests:

  ```
  $ rspec /home/ubuntu/Dev/praticas-devsoft/infosimples-repo/week2/exercises/w2-e1/w2-e1-spec.rb
  ```

8. Push this branch to GitHub. This push should create a new remote branch called `u_NUSP/b1` branch.

  __Hint__: you can use the `git push` command full syntax:
  ```
  git push {remote} {local_branch}:{remote_branch}
  ```

  replacing "{remote}", "{local_branch}" and "{remote_branch}" with the appropriate values.

  __IMPORTANT: DO NOT PUSH TO MASTER. PUSHING TO MASTER WILL CAUSE YOU TO LOSE POINTS.__
